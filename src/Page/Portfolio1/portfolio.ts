This enables you to gain increased liquidity in the form of a soft-pegged US Dollar stablecoin, while maintaining original asset exposure. Your STX tokens generate a yield, which pays back the USDA loan automatically over time. At current yields, it takes about 3 years to pay back your loan completely. No need to worry about monthly payments.",
